# CIS183_HW02_Program1

This program allows a user to find colors using SeekBars within Android Studio. With the Red, Blue, and Green slider they are able to see the colors Hex value,
and save that color to a ListView. If the user clicks on the color they saved, it changes the background of their screen to match that given color, along
with changing the slider values automatically and showing the Hex value.

# Problems
I didn't run into many issues with this assignment. The Adapter class is a little confusing to me still but I think doing this assignment solidified my uncomfortablity
with making seperate Java classes and having them work in tandem with each other.
